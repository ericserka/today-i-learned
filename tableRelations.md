# 1-to-N and N-to-N relationships between tables in a SQL database

- 1-to-N: the foreign key must be created in table N, which references table 1.
- N-to-N: an auxiliary table must be created (table1-table2) that must have two foreign keys: one that references table 1 and one that references table 2.
